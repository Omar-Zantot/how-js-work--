### 📝 JavaScript Key Concepts

#### 📌 High-Level Language

- **Resource Management**: Every program requires hardware resources like memory and CPU.

- **Low-Level Languages**: In languages like C, you manually manage these resources (e.g., memory allocation).

- **High-Level Languages**: In languages like JavaScript and Python:
  - No need to manually manage resources.
  - These languages provide abstractions that handle resource management.
  - Easier to learn and use.
  - Downsides: Programs may not be as fast or optimized as those written in low-level languages.

#### 🗑️ Garbage Collection

- **Definition**: An algorithm within the JavaScript engine.
- **Function**: Automatically removes old, unused objects from memory.
- **Purpose**: Prevents memory clogging with unnecessary data.
- **Analogy**: Think of it as JavaScript having a "cleaning guy" who tidies up memory, so developers don't need to handle it manually in code.
